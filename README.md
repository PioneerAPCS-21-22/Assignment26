# Assignment 26

For this assignment you will create a simple chatbot that will respond to what the human says.

For example: if the user says "I love my cats!" the chatbot will respond with "Tell me more about your pets."

## Specifications

### Part 1
Download the starter code, which includes `Main.java` and `Chatbot.java` and follow the directions given by the comments.

For `Main.java`:

* Create a Chatbot object.
* Print the greeting.
* Fix the `while` statement so that it isn't case sensitive.
* Print the chatbot's response (inside the loop).

For `Chatbot.java`:

* In `getGreeting()`, return a message to greet the user when they start the program.
* In `getResponse()`, fill in the if statement to check if the user's statement contains "no" and fill in the else if to check if the user's statement contains "cat" or "dog".
* In `getRandomResponse()`, generate a random generic statement (have at least four to choose from).
